                    <h1>Howdy, thanks for visiting my website</h1>
                    <p>First of all I want to spell out, that this page was made just as a fun project from Udemy course of Jordan Hudgens, he showed how to do it, I just followed along, I do not own, the images, I downloaded them from google, I do not own the logos, I used Jordan's ones.</p>
                    <p>Now, when that has been stated, I hope you like my little project, I code it myself, under the guidence, but still, I like the design, it showed me some more information about animation and JavaScript, which is what I lacked in my previous project, which had been built just by me and my imagination.</p>
                    <p>I will link the video from youtube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bMdjkfvONE" target="_blank">here</a>, and if you have any questions, you can contact me on email (Okutabetsu@seznam.cz). So thank you again and see you later.</p>
